# mod-installer
Grand Theft Auto V mod installer

Place dlcpacks in input/dlcpacks file
Place scripts in input/scripts

The script may not work 100% of the time and is recommended to verify with the readme included in the original mod folder

if for whatever reason the script constantly crashes, reset settings.ini by running the recovery.exe file included in the file (must have an active internet connection)

if you encounter any bugs/gitches please messege me on discord : chalie#4059
